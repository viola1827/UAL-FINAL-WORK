# README for Emotion Visualizer Project
## Overview
The Emotion Visualizer is an interactive web-based application designed to analyze audio input in real-time and generate synchronized visualizations to reflect emotional states. By using microphone input and audio frequency analysis, the tool detects emotional attributes (e.g., Calm, Happy, Sad, Angry) and provides a multisensory experience combining visual and auditory feedback.

## Features
### Emotion Detection:

Analyzes audio frequency bands (bass, mid, treble) to infer emotional states.
Displays real-time emotion transitions and confidence levels.
Dynamic Visualization:

Generates interactive, dynamic graphics that adapt to sound frequencies and volumes.
Visual effects like background gradients, particle systems, and spectrum rings respond to detected emotions.
Audio Input Control:

Includes "Start Audio" and "Recording" options to enable microphone input.
Captures real-time audio metrics (volume, bass/treble ratios, etc.) for analysis.
Data Recording:

Allows users to record data and save visual snapshots or JSON files containing audio metrics.
Responsive Design:

Visualization scales automatically with browser window size.
Designed for seamless interaction across devices.


## Setup Instructions
### Requirements:

A web browser supporting modern JavaScript (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
Access to a microphone for audio input.
